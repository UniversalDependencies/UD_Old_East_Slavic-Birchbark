# Introduction

The treebank is based on the Corpus of Novgorod Birchbark Letters written in 1025-1500 and includes
documents written in an East Slavic vernacular (letters, household and business records, records
for church services, spell against diseases, and other short inscriptions). The birchbark letters
were found during archaeological excavations in Novgorod the Great and provide rare evidence of
everyday writing in pre-Mongol East Slavic dialects. The fact that many documents are damaged
and/or fragmented, together with the diversity of the spelling traditions presented in them, makes
them an interesting case for linguistic analysis and historical NLP research.
