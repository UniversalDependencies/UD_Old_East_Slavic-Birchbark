# Summary

UD Old\_East\_Slavic-Birchbark is based on the RNC Corpus of Birchbark Letters and includes
documents written in 1025-1500 in an East Slavic vernacular (letters, household and business records, 
records for church services, spell against diseases, and other short inscriptions). 
The treebank is manually syntactically annotated in the UD 2.0 scheme, 
morphological and lexical annotation is a conversion of the original RNC annotation.  

# Introduction

The treebank is based on the historical Corpus of Birchbark Letters written in 1025-1500. 
It is part of the Russian National Corpus and includes documents written in an East Slavic vernacular (letters, 
household and business records, records for church services, spell against diseases, and other short inscriptions). 
The birchbark letters were found during archaeological excavations in Novgorod the Great, Staraya Russa, and other East Slavic cites 
and provide rare evidence of everyday writing in pre-Mongol East Slavic dialects. 
The fact that many documents are damaged and/or fragmented, together with the diversity of the spelling traditions 
presented in them, makes them an interesting case for linguistic analysis and historical NLP research.

The digital copies of the letters are reproduced online in a database available at http://gramoty.ru, where the hypotheses on tokenisation 
are also provided. The morphological analysis was originally done under the Russian National Corpus scheme for the Corpus of Birchbark Letters, 
which is mostly compatible with the RNC Old Russian scheme. Lemmatization reflects the later Old Russian spelling tradition. 
The morphological and lexical annotation of the UD Old\_East\_Slavic-Birchbark treebank is a conversion of this annotation that follows the mapping 
in (Lyashevskaya 2019). The dependency annotation is originally done in the UD 2.0 scheme. 

# Acknowledgments

Tokenisation, lexical and morphological analysis is primarily based on the study _Old Novgorod Dialect_ by Andrey Zaliznyak as well as other studies by 
Valentin Yanin, Andrey Zaliznyak, Alexey Gippius, Dmitry Sichinava, and other researchers of East Slavic vernacular. 
We thank the developers and annotators of the RNC Corpus of Birchbark Letters.
